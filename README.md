### Greetings! 

I am a Pythonista who loves programming to solve data problems and questions. 🐍 I have worked flexibly to write code in:
* Data science and statistics 👩🏻‍🔬
* Data engineering and cloud services 👩🏻‍🔧
* Software engineering 👩🏻‍💻

The vast majority of the code I have written over the past 4 years has been developed for my employers and therefore cannot be shared. 🔒 I have a few small projects and code snippets here for reference. Please reach out to me if you are interested in learning more about the projects I enjoy working on! 💬

The main languages I work in are: 
* Python 🐍
* R 🏴‍☠️
* SQL 📺
* Shell script/command line 🐚
